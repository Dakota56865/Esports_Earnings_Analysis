# Esports Earnings Analysis: A Global Study

## Introduction
This project analyzes the growth of the esports industry from 2010 to 2023, with a focus on total earnings by country, key games, player participation, and future projections. The dataset includes global earnings, player data, and historical records of esports tournaments.

The project was conducted in Python, using libraries such as `pandas`, `folium`, and `scikit-learn`. The final analysis and visualizations were created using Tableau.

### Data Sources
1. **Esports Earnings Dataset (2010-2023)** - Collected from [example-dataset-source](https://example-dataset.com).
2. **Country Shapefile (GeoJSON)** - Downloaded from [Datahub](https://datahub.io/core/geo-countries).
3. **Time Series Data for Esports Trends** - Collected from various open sources related to player counts and revenue.

### Project Structure
- `data/`: Contains raw and cleaned data files used in the project.
- `scripts/`: Python scripts for data cleaning, analysis, and modeling.
- `notebooks/`: Jupyter notebooks used for exploratory data analysis and visualization.
- `README.md`: Overview of the project, data sources, and steps taken.

### Key Insights
1. **Top Earning Countries**: The United States leads with over $63 billion in esports earnings, followed by China and South Korea.
2. **Top Games**: Games like **Dota 2** and **Fortnite** dominate earnings per tournament.
3. **Player Growth**: Player participation peaked in 2019, correlating with earnings but showing a slight decline in recent years.
4. **Future Projections**: Earnings are projected to rise through 2025, though player growth may stabilize.

### Analysis Techniques
- **Data Cleaning**: Handled missing values, standardized dates, and merged datasets.
- **Exploratory Analysis**: Examined correlations between earnings, games, and player counts.
- **Clustering**: Conducted cluster analysis to group countries based on earnings and player engagement.
- **Forecasting**: Used time series forecasting to predict future trends in earnings and players.
